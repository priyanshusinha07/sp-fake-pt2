    <h1>My Journey: Fake URL Detection Tool</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>How I Got the Idea</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>
            I got the idea for creating the fake website detection tool after witnessing the growing number of online scams. In todayâ€™s digital age, scammers are constantly creating fake websites to steal money from unsuspecting people. One of my close friends even fell victim to such a scam, which deeply affected me. Seeing how easy it was for people to get tricked, I decided to build a tool to help prevent this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started researching how websites can be identified as fraudulent, including examining URL patterns, website metadata, and known scam tactics. After weeks of reading about online security, I began developing a prototype and  create a resource not only for my friends but for anyone who could benefit from it, to protect themselves and their loved ones from online fraud.
        </p>

    <h2>How I Built the Detection Tool</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>
            I built the fake URL detection tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core functionality relies on a machine learning model trained to identify suspicious patterns in URLs and websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            I integrated this model with a database that stores known phishing domains and scam tactics. The tool analyzes URL patterns I also wanted the tool to be user-friendly, so I built a simple interface that allows users to input a URL and get an instant report about whether it's safe or not.providing real-time feedback on whether a URL is safe or potentially fraudulent, offering users an effective way to stay protected online.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>
            After completing the initial version of the tool, I started getting positive feedback from friends and users online. More people started using it to check URLs before clicking on them, and I was encouraged to improve it further. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm working on adding more advanced features like analyzing website content for red flags and enhancing the detection algorithm with machine learning models to identify phishing attempts even better.
        </p>

            "Creating this tool has not only made the internet a safer place for others, but it has also been an incredible learning experience for me."
